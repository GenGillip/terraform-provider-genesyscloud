Genesys Cloud Routing Skill Group

## API Usage
The following Genesys Cloud APIs are used by this resource. Ensure your OAuth Client has been granted the necessary scopes and permissions to perform these operations:

* [GET /api/v2/routing/skillgroups](https://developer.genesys.cloud/platform/preview-apis#get-api-v2-routing-skillgroups)
* [POST /api/v2/routing/skillgroups](https://developer.genesys.cloud/platform/preview-apis#post-api-v2-routing-skillgroups)
* [PATCH /api/v2/routing/skillgroups/{skillGroupId}](https://developer.genesys.cloud/platform/preview-apis#patch-api-v2-routing-skillgroups--skillGroupId-)
* [DELETE /api/v2/routing/skillgroups/{skillGroupId}](https://developer.genesys.cloud/platform/preview-apis#delete-api-v2-routing-skillgroups--skillGroupId-)

**NOTE: The Routing Skill Groups feature is currently in beta and preview.  This means while the APIs are available in preview (they can change).  The feature is in a closed beta.  You must be part of the beta in order to use this resource.  If you are not part of the beta, ths resource will not function properly for you.  Please contact Chris Bohlin (chris.bohlin@genesys.com) to be added to the beta.

## Example Usage
The skill group resource allows you define highly complicated and recursive rules for determining group membership. Therefore,
the `skill_conditions` field will accept a JSON string rather then standard HCL for defining the rules that can be applied to group membership.

Here are a few example rules:


```terraform
resource "genesyscloud_routing_skill_group" "myskillgroup" {
    name= "My Test Group"
    description = "Not cool group"
    skill_conditions = jsonencode(
      [
        {
        "routingSkillConditions": [
            {
            "routingSkill": "Series 6",
            "comparator": "GreaterThan",
            "proficiency": 2,
            "childConditions": {
                "routingSkillConditions": [],
                "languageSkillConditions": [],
                "operation": "And"
            }
            }
        ],
        "languageSkillConditions": [],
        "operation": "And"
        }]
    )
}
```

This will create a skill group where all of the members must have a series 6 license with a skill rating>2.  **Note**:  Since the `skills_conditions` attribute accepts a JSON string of conditions, you need to the `jsonencode` function around the JSON to safely encode it.

Here is an example of a more complicated skill group where you want Agents who have a series 6 or series 7 license at a level 5 proficiency and who speak spanish:

```
resource "genesyscloud_routing_skill_group" "spanish_investment_specialists" {
  name        = "SpanishInvestmentSpecialists"
  description = "Agents with a Series 6 or Series 7 license and are proficient in Spanish (level 3)"
  skill_conditions = jsonencode(
    [
      {
        "routingSkillConditions" : [
          {
            "routingSkill" : "Series 6",
            "comparator" : "EqualTo",
            "proficiency" : 5,
            "childConditions" : {
              "routingSkillConditions" : [
                {
                  "routingSkill" : "Series 7",
                  "comparator" : "EqualTo",
                  "proficiency" : 5,
                  "childConditions" : {
                    "routingSkillConditions" : [],
                    "languageSkillConditions" : [],
                    "operation" : "And"
                  }
                }
              ],
              "languageSkillConditions" : [],
              "operation" : "And"
            }
          }
        ],
        "languageSkillConditions" : [],
        "operation" : "And"
      },
      {
        "routingSkillConditions" : [],
        "languageSkillConditions" : [
          {
            "languageSkill" : "Spanish",
            "comparator" : "GreaterThanOrEqualTo",
            "proficiency" : 3,
            "childConditions" : {
              "routingSkillConditions" : [],
              "languageSkillConditions" : [],
              "operation" : "And"
            }
          }
        ],
        "operation" : "And"
      }
    ]
  )
}
```

**Pro-tip**:  Rather then build these expression from scratch, I recommend using the UI to build a sample group and then use the GET skillgroups APIs to retrieve the generated expression.
